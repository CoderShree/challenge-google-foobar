# challenge-google-foobar

Hey Guys,

This is **Shrikant Pawar**. Thanks for stopping by.

This is my way to give back to fellow nerds, to help them understand google coding challenges.
Recently, I have received a coding challenge from google.

It all started when I was browsing something related to Java 8 JVM on google and a notification popped up, asking if I was interested in solving coding challenges.
When I clicked "yes, I am interested".
I was redirected to https://foobar.withgoogle.com/

What is it?
-------------------
It is basically secret hiring process. It is obviously by invite, which is sent by google hiring team.

What is the process?

My solutions for google's foobar challenge https://foobar.withgoogle.com

Tasks are split by levels, each next level is harder than previous one.

Number of tasks by levels are distributed like this:

Level 1 - 1 task
Level 2 - 2 task
Level 3 - 3 task
Level 4 - 2 task
Level 5 - 1 task

I've solved L1 Part 1 till now.

I'll keep you updating/posting my further progress.

Thanks,
rusty.marble :p
